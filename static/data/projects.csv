Control4Reuse	Member (WP2)	2018 - Current	Control4Reuse is aimed at research and development of technologies for managing water resources. The optimization of water treatment and reclamation systems has been integrated as a sustainable solution to improve the reuse of this valuable water resource. The focus is on the reuse of wastewater (WW) in specific agricultural and industrial sectors. From a technological point of view, the scope of the project is based on a system monitoring and control framework, with specific activities of monitoring and integrating sensor information/data, mathematical modelling of processes and designing advanced control strategies.	https://sites.google.com/view/control4reuse
