	<div class="post_text_content"> <h2>Introduction Systems and control objectives</h2>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<p>In this series, I will present the notes from my studies in the design of robust and optimal controllers. 
My goal is to formulate this task through functional analysis: The set of achievable control laws (feedback functions) is explicitly characterized, then an optimal controller is directly synthesized. As such, we are here focusing on model-based approaches in the sense that also the controller is modelled. This differs slightly from other popular approaches: In <em>direct optimal control</em>, we usually search on the space of sequences of control actions (although an explicit control law can be derived in special cases). This approach has the disadvantage that the <em>closed-loop system</em> cannot be characterized, and thus neither the analysis of its performance, stability and robustness. Moreover, I hope to show how we can more naturally study control theory from a game-theoretical, or multi-agent, perspective by focusing on the controller synthesis approach. </p>
<p>In the following, we introduce some notation and present the notion of <strong>system</strong> (and their models) together with the <strong>control objectives</strong> which we are interested to solve. </p>
<h3>Dynamical (controlled) systems</h3>
<p>We consider generalized control systems as represented in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="/static/blog/robust_optimal_control/Diagram_SSIO.png", alt="Control system block-diagram", style="width:100%"/></p>
<p>The plant or system (\(P\)) is manipulated by our controller (\(K\)) through the control signal \( u: [0,\infty) \to \mathcal{U}~\subseteq~\mathbb{R}^{N_u} \), which is computed from the output (or measurement) signal \( y : [0,\infty) \to \mathcal{Y}~\subseteq~\mathbb{R}^{N_y}\ \) to produce a desired performance signal  \( z : [0,\infty) \to \mathcal{Z}~\subseteq~\mathbb{R}^{N_z} \). Consider these as "real" signals, i.e., signals that can be actually measured and produced by the instruments/components of our systems. Conversely, we assume both the controller and the plant to have internal signals: The system state \( x : [0,\infty) \to \mathcal{X}~\subseteq~\mathbb{R}^{N_x} \) and the controller state \( \xi : [0,\infty) \to {\Xi}~\subseteq~\mathbb{R}^{N_{\xi}} \). These are (latent) signals that we use to describe the dynamics of our systems. Finally, the plant is subjected to a disturbance signal \( w : [0,\infty) \to \mathcal{W}~\subseteq~\mathbb{R}^{N_w} \) representing exogenous factors that affect its evolution. The sets \( (\mathcal{X},\mathcal{U},\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{Z},{\Xi},\mathcal{W}) \) define the spaces for each signal. Formally, we will represent the systems through the LTI models

        \begin{aligned}

                   u(t)  &amp;= C_K \xi(t) + D_K y(t)

            A_K &amp; B_K \\
            \hline
            C_K &amp; D_K
        \end{array} }

            \dot{x}(t) &amp;= A x(t) + B u(t) + G_x w(t) \\
                 y(t)  &amp;= C x(t) + D u(t) + G_y w(t) \\
                 z(t)  &amp;= Q x(t) + R u(t) + G_z w(t)
        \end{aligned} 
    \right. \\[2ex]
    &amp; \text{[IO]}\quad  P = \left[ \raise-0.2em{
        \begin{array}{c | c c} 
            A &amp; B &amp; G_x \\
            \hline
            C &amp; D &amp; G_y \\
            Q &amp; R &amp; G_z

    \right]

where [SS] stands for a state-space realization and [IO] stands for the equivalent input-output model. For those unfamiliar, a state-space model is simply a system of ODEs describing how the state changes in time, and its algebraic relationship with the measurement and performance signals. The input-output model (a.k.a., the <em>transfer function</em>) is the direct mapping between input and output signals; which, in this context, is equivalent to the Laplace transform of the state-space system (see <a href="#">Appendix A</a>). Here, we must reinforce an important remark: IO models are unique, whereas SS models are not. In fact, this is why I will be mostly referring to \( (\Sigma_K, \Sigma_P) \) as realizations, while denoting \( (K, P) \) as models. Now, a word of caution:</p>
<div class="tex-block remark">
  Systems are real entities, but models are always just abstractions. You should never forget that when we refer to the systems through  \( (\Sigma_K,\Sigma_P) \) and \( (K,P) \) we are making an assumption, regardless of how good these models are. In this series, we assume those models to be representative of the "real" systems, and we use them to design controllers which are tested through simulation. You should have in the back of your mind that the real system might not behave as our simulations; in fact, that is major motivation for robust methods. In summary, beware of <b>plant-model mismatch</b>.
</div>

<p>In these notes, we will assume that all signals and systems are from specific classes of "realistic" functions. That is, we are interested in classes of signals endowed with some description of "energy" or "information", and we focus on classes of systems representing causal mappings. Unless stated otherwise, this will translate formally into the following assumptions</p>
<ul>
<li>\( x,\xi,u,w,y,z~\in~\mathcal{L}_2[0,\infty)\quad \) or \(\quad  x,\xi,u,w,y,z~\in~\mathcal{L}_{\infty} [0,\infty) \) \(\quad {\color{gray}\text{(All signals are square-integrable or essentially bounded)}}\) <br> 
<!--  The Hilbert Space \\( \mathcal{L}\_2 \\) represents the so-called _energy-signals_, corresponding to functions \\( \phi \\) whose norm \\( \| \phi \|\_{\mathcal{L}\_2} < \infty \\) denotes a measure of finite energy (or size). Informally, this can be thought as the class of _stable_ signals such that \\( \lim\_{t\to\infty}\phi(t) = 0 \\) (which is the case for signals representing natural phenomenon). Similarly, the Banach Space  \\( \mathcal{L}\_{\infty} \\) represents signals with bounded amplitude.
  --></li>
<li>\( P,K~\in~\mathcal{H}_2\hspace{6.9em} \) or \(\quad P,K~\in~\mathcal{H}_{\infty}\quad \) \(\hspace{6em} {\color{gray}\text{(Systems are strictly proper and stable, or proper and bounded)}}\) </li>
</ul>
<p>The Hilbert space \( \mathcal{L}_2 \) of so-called <em>energy signals</em> represents functions whose norm encodes a notion of energy (or size) which is finite, as is the case of signals describing naturally occurring phenomena. When discussing a signal which does not dissipate its total energy (e.g., periodic signals), we consider the Banach space of (essentially) bounded functions \( \mathcal{L}_{\infty} \). Similarly, the Hardy space \( \mathcal{H}_2 \) represents <strong>strictly</strong> proper systems which are stable, i.e., that behave as contractive maps. When discussing systems which are only proper and not contractive, but whose magnitude bounds are known, we consider the Banach/Hardy space \( \mathcal{H}_{\infty} \). </p>
<h4>System responses, closed-loop responses and discrete-time systems</h4>
<p>In the following, we restrict the discussion to the models \( (\Sigma_P, P) \) since everything follows to \( (\Sigma_K, K) \). 
An important advantage of the linear representation is that we can analytically solve any initial-value problem (IVPs) for the ODEs in Eq. (1). Without loss of generality, let \( w = 0 \) in the following.</p>
<div class="tex-block theorem" title="Solution of a linear system">
  The solution of \( \dot{x} = Ax + Bu \) given initial state \( x(0) = x_0 \) is
  \begin{equation}  \tag{2} 
    x(t) = \Phi(t)x_0 + (\Phi B * u)(t), 
  \end{equation}
  where \( \Phi(t) = e^{At} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {t^k \over k!}A^k \) is the matrix exponential of \( (At) \).

  <br>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="proof-toggle-button" id="proof-toggle-button-th_CayleyHamilton_Proof" type="button" onclick="toggle_proof('th_CayleyHamilton_Proof')">[Proof]</a>
<div class="tex-proof" id="th_CayleyHamilton_Proof">
    TO-DO
  </div>
</div>

<p>Consequently, the output response of the system \( \Sigma_P \) is given by \( y(t) = C\Phi(t)x_0 + (C \Phi B * u)(t) + Du(t) \). Assuming \(x_0 = 0 \), we can find the familiar expression \( y(t) = (C\Phi(t)B + D\delta(t))*u(t) \) whose Laplace transform is \( Y(s) = (C\hat{\Phi}(s)B + D)U(s) \). This hints that the matrix-exponential \( \Phi \) characterises the system response in \( \Sigma_P \) completely in the same way that the characteristic polynomial \( \hat{\Phi}(s) = (sI - A)^{-1} \) defines the response in \( P \). Thus, the system matrix \( A \) will be a central factor when studying our systems. Also, this relationship is what motivates the shorthand notation introduced in Eq. (1) for the IO models: Those divided matrices should be interpreted as the Schur complement of the matrix obtained by substituting \( A \) with \( -\hat{\Phi}(s) \) (and concatenating (\(u,w\)) and (\(y,z\)) into single vectors),
\[
  P = \left[ \raise-0.2em{
      \begin{array}{c | c c} 
          A &amp; B &amp; G_x \\
          \hline
          C &amp; D &amp; G_y \\
          Q &amp; R &amp; G_z
      \end{array} }
    \right] 
    = \texttt{Schur}\left( \begin{bmatrix} 
        -\hat{\Phi}(s) &amp; B &amp; G_x \\
        C &amp; D &amp; G_y \\
        Q &amp; R &amp; G_z \end{bmatrix} \right)
        = \left[ \raise-0.2em{
        \begin{array}{c c} 
        C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D &amp; C(sI - A)^{-1}G_x + G_y \\[1ex]
        Q(sI - A)^{-1}B + R &amp; Q(sI - A)^{-1}G_x + G_z
        \end{array} }
      \right] 
    = \left[ \raise-0.2em{
      \begin{array}{c c} 
      P_{11} &amp; P_{12} \\[1ex]
      P_{21} &amp; P_{22}
      \end{array} }
    \right]
\]</p>
<p>Take a moment to read those functions above, as they will become important later. Finally, note by the above formulas that the effect of disturbances in Eq. (2) can be accounted by adding the term \( (\Phi G_x * w)(t) \).</p>
<p>(closed-loop response)</p>
<h3>Control objectives</h3>
<h3>Outline of these notes</h3>
<p>This series is expected to be rather long. I will focus on building the theory in a constructive and detailed fashion; thus, this will probably not be a good cheat-sheet of formulas and (pseudo)codes. 
I will not assume that you are familiar with control theory: You should be able to follow the material if you have an understanding of calculus and linear algebra. The level, however, is going to be higher than that of an undergraduate control theory course (also because these courses are oftentimes more about the practice than the theory). </p>
